        <p class="about-text"> Kia ora everyone! My name is Sophia, I was raised in T훮maki Makaurau, Auckland but I have spent (and spend) a large amount of time in Te R훮whiti, Northland where I consider home. I have a background in the arts and music and for the past 5 years I was living in Berlin, Germany. Most of my time there I was pursuing music and generally just taking the opportunity to have fun and travel lots.
            In 2020 I returned to study in Berlin studying politics and art, but due to Covid and my partner being here, I decided to move home this year.
            After returning to Aotearoa, I am in the process of figuring out my new path and place in this beautiful country, which has led me here. My values lie deeply in my political beliefs and my positioning as a queer woman who holds privilege as a cis-gendered P훮keh훮. I value the ability to reflect, learn and grow (which I have found often means a lot of unlearning).
            Looking forward to meeting you all!</p>
