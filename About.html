        <p class="text"> Kia ora everyone! My name is Sophia, I am a 26yr budding developer from Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland, Aotearoa. 

            I have a background in the arts and music and for the past 5 years I was living in Berlin, Germany. In 2020 I returned to study at Bard College Berlin, studying politics and art, but due to Covidgit I decided to move home.
             Since returning to Aotearoa, I am figuring out my new path and place in this beautiful country. This has led me to begin studying web development at Enspiral Dev Academy. 
             My values lie deeply in my political beliefs and my positioning as a queer woman who holds privilege as a cis-gendered Pākehā. I value my community and the ability to reflect, learn and grow (which I have found often means a lot of unlearning). 
             As apart of this course this blog will follow me on my web development journey.
