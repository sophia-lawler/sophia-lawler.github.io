<p class="text-questions"> Sprint One Core: Values and Identity  </p>


<p class="text"> Throughout my twenties I have spent a lot of time thinking about my core values and how that plays out in the way I live my life and my identity. My values lie deeply in my political beliefs and my positioning as a queer woman who holds privilege as a cis-gendered Pākehā. I value the ability to reflect, learn and grow (which I have found often means a lot of unlearning). 
    For the most part, I had a pretty privileged childhood. There were times of hardship but we always got through and we always had enough. My parents were creative, open-minded and loving people who always pushed me to think outside the box, to question everything and to act with care. They instilled in me from a very young age a value in people which to this day continues to shape who I am. I value not just those who I love and those in my community, but just generally people. I believe a value in people means a value in everything from the environment to healthcare, education, and the rights of those who the colonial and capitalist systems inherently devalue. In Aotearoa I believe valuing people means actively engaging in decolonisation, honoring Te Tiriti o Waitangi and rejecting the continued colonisation of Aotearoa which violently dispossesses Māori from their land and culture, while denying them the same socio-economic access as Pākehā. </p>
     
    <p class="text-questions">  Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity </p>
     
    <p class="text">  As a Pākehā New Zealander who has been living overseas, I have a complicated relationship with Aotearoa and ideas around ‘culture’. On my father’s side I am second generation Irish and English and on my mother’s side my ancestors were some of the first European settlers who colonised the land and shamefully abused Tangaroa’s passage. Something I became more and more aware of in Berlin (which is known as a “melting-pot” city) is that as a Pākehā, I didn’t represent or feel any ownership or belonging to a culture. I don’t believe there is a homogenous white culture and the white-washed ‘Kiwiana’ permeating our national imagination which reveres rugby, marmite and white bread doesn’t do much for me. That is not to say that I do not feel anything about Aotearoa, quite the opposite, I missed it deeply being away. I feel extremely connected to the natural and spiritual elements of Aotearoa which as someone who is not indigenous are feelings that I am trying to reconcile with. I am constantly influenced and inspired by te ao Māori, but I lay no claim of being within the culture and merely a grateful witness. Although I feel deeply embedded within the queer community, I also acknowledge that contemporary queer culture lies deep in the tradition of the queer black (and mainly black trans) experience for which I too cannot make claim to. In saying that, both of these communities and cultures have deeply enriched my values and beliefs.</p>
     
    <p class="text-questions">  Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </p>
     
        <p class="text"> In 2017 I worked at a magazine, where the Director (an older white german straight male) said something racist within a meeting. The room went very silent and as a young junior writer, who was fairly new to the team, I sat there in silence and said nothing. My colleagues and I discussed it later, appalled, but all of us were too scared to speak up in fear of losing our jobs. Years later, after leaving the magazine, my old boss was called out on social media when an email was leaked also spouting out racist and homophobic rhetoric. The director had very little to do with the content of the magazine and was purely the money behind the project. The content was led by a team of mainly women, many queer and many POC who had wanted to highlight the many diverse creative voices doing incredible things in Berlin and Europe. However, in the end the intention didnt matter, our ongoing silence led to many queer and POC people who had been featured in the magazine and involved in projects with us being very hurt. The very people our team had wanted to celebrate felt used and merely objects of the directors capital gain and social clout. Our silence caused a lot of harm. </p>
     
            <p class="text-questions"> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development. </p>
    
                <p class="text"> My friends and community have always been a priority in my life and I would like to think that has given me great human skills. I have worked in a lot of team environments, I have been FOH for multiple salons, had leadership roles in hospitality and worked as a team in studios and office environments. I play in multiple bands and have always made music collaboratively. I love puzzles and games and have the ability to think outside of the box and be creative. All of which I believe will be useful in web development and code. When I have time to work on a piece, I am a good writer and when I am passionate about something, I have the ability to put a lot of time and effort into it. For some reason I get very shy in academic settings, I do not enjoy public speaking and often get very nervous if I think I have to prove any intellectual ability.</p>
                    <p class="text"> I heavily struggle with concentration and time management. I find it difficult at times to organise my thoughts and to prioritise the tasks necessary which often means I do the easiest but possibly not the most important task first.</p>
    
                        <p class="text"> I am still figuring out my whiteness and privilege. In doing this I can sometimes make mistakes, however I am learning the ways in which we all need to be accountable, reflect and unlearn which will all allow us to be better allies, communicators and members of the community - workforce included. I do not have much tolerance for bigotry, I realise that in the workforce this can also be deemed as a weakness because there will always be assholes in this world, but after letting things slide in the past and seeing the result, I actually consider this a strength.</p>

<p class="text-questions"> Sprint Two Core: Learning Plan  </p>

<p class="text-questions"> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </p>
<p class="text"> My long term-plan is to be able to afford life comfortably while still being able to focus on music and creative endeavours which do not have monetary gain. I want to do freelance developing while finishing my other studies and playing music. 
</p>
<p class="text-questions"> A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning  </p>
<p class="text">I am creative and I like to think I have the ability to think outside of the box. I am passionate when it comes to things I love. However, I have recently discovered I have ADHD which has explained a lot of my past problems within education. I have always suffered from concentration, organising my thoughts, sticking to time schedules, reading academic texts and writing fast. For a short stint I worked at a magazine in Berlin writing articles about contemporary art and culture but because of the necessary amount of output I struggled to keep up. 
</p>
<p class="text-questions"> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?  </p>
<p class="text">I would like to get better at managing my time and organising my workload. I have bought myself a daily planner, I find that writing things down and being able to visualise the things I need to do rather than just having them written on an app or screen is helping. When things are building up and starting to get frustrating I think it is important to allow myself time to do something else, go for a walk or make a meal.
</p>
<p class="text-questions"> How and where will I seek help? </p>
<p class="text">I will always try the internet first and if I can't find the solution, I can ask my GF who is a developer, and my flatmate who is also taking the course. If those fail I will ask my facilitators. 
</p>
<p class="text-questions"> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
    <p class="text">Just general support, checking in and helping when necessary.</p>
<p class="text-questions"> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.  </p>
<p class="text">Every Tuesday I have band practice, and on the weekends I work at Whammy Bar music venue which means that I am normally quite tired on Saturday and Sundays and require sleep-ins.
