            Give an analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
        </p>
        <p class="text">
             If we compare them to a human body, HTML is the skeleton and inner workings of the body, while CSS is the skin, hair, complexion and what you perceive.

             Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Control flow is the order in which you tell the computer to process information, sometimes this means to only process information in the case of XY or Z with different functions and loops in each case. Loops are used to do a function multiple times. For instance, When I drive to work there is an order in which I start the car. First I put my seat belt on, I put my foot on the brake, I put my keys in the car and turn the car on, I put the car into drive, I release the handbrake and I take my foot of the brake as I navigate my way out of park. As I perform this function every time I get into the car, I can loop this exact function so that it is performed m-f every week at 9am. The control flow is the order in which these events take place. The flow of events can be altered and the loop cut if one of the tasks can not be performed. For instance, in my loop function of starting the car, if the car does not start  the loop would stop and a second function would be implemented, in which I may examine the car, or call AA etc.

            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The DOM is the online live interface of viewing the code of a webpage, you may interact with this through the console, where you may look up specific parts of the code and even temporarily change it and instantly see the effects which you can then implement onto the real code if this was your own website.

             Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Both arrays and objects are data types which store information. An array can be considered a list of values, for instance the array “shopping list” could be (pears, apples, rice) using a data indexing system (0, 1, 2) 0=pears, 2=rice. An object stores much more complex information, that can not be simply listed as there is normally more than one value type such as “employee contacts” { name: James, age: 24, email: james@gmail.com, name: Sophia, age: 74, email: sophia74@gmail.com} rather than shopping list which only has things on the list, employee contacts, has further indexing with names, age and email.
